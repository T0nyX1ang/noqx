# Noqx

[Noqx](https://github.com/T0nyX1ang/noqx) is an extended logic puzzle solver of [Noq](https://github.com/mstang107/noq).

- Try it through this [portal](./penpa-edit/){:target="\_blank"}.

## New features

### New features from `Noq`

- Acquire enhanced efficiency and more solvers (140+ currently).

- Change the backend from `Django` to `Starlette` with `Uvicorn` (See issues [#31](https://github.com/T0nyX1ang/noqx/issues/31) and [#50](https://github.com/T0nyX1ang/noqx/issues/50)).

- Change the frontend to `Penpa+`. (See issue [#36](https://github.com/T0nyX1ang/noqx/issues/36)).

- Obtain uniform data structures in every puzzle. (See issues [#84](https://github.com/T0nyX1ang/noqx/issues/84) and [#109](https://github.com/T0nyX1ang/noqx/issues/109)).

- Deploy the entire solver to GitHub Pages with the help of `PyScript`. No backend server is needed in this mode.

### New usages from `Penpa+`

- Select puzzle type.

- Show rules in [puzz.link](https://puzz.link/list.html) if possible.

- Choose example puzzle.

- Show/Edit parameters of the solver if possible.

- Solve/Reset the puzzle.

## How to run locally

- Make sure the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (v14) is installed on Windows.

### Use `uv` with a virtual environment (Recommended)

- Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) first.

- Clone this project and switch to `master` branch.

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/T0nyX1ang/noqx.git
```

- Create a virtual environment (Optional):

```bash
    uv venv
```

- Install non-development packages with `uv`:

```bash
    uv sync --extra web --no-dev
```

- Run with `uv`:

```bash
    uv run main.py
```

### Use PIP

- Install requirements (automatically generated by `uv`):

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Clone this project and switch to `master` branch.

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/T0nyX1ang/noqx.git
```

- Run locally (based on your system):

```bash
    py -3 main.py
    python3 main.py
```

### Use prebuilt releases (Windows only)

- Download the latest release [package](https://github.com/T0nyX1ang/noqx/releases).

- A new version is released occasionally.

### Additional Parameters

```text
  usage: main.py [-h] [-H HOST] [-p PORT] [-d] [-tl TIME_LIMIT] [-pt PARALLEL_THREADS] [-D] [-B]
  usage: main.exe [-h] [-H HOST] [-p PORT] [-d] [-tl TIME_LIMIT] [-pt PARALLEL_THREADS] [-D] [-B]

  noqx startup settings.

  options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -H HOST, --host HOST  the host to run the server on.
    -p PORT, --port PORT  the port to run the server on.
    -d, --debug           whether to enable debug mode with auto-reloading.
    -tl TIME_LIMIT, --time_limit TIME_LIMIT
                          time limit in seconds.
    -pt PARALLEL_THREADS, --parallel_threads PARALLEL_THREADS
                          parallel threads.
    -D, --enable_deployment
                          enable deployment for client-side purposes.
    -B, --build-document  build the documentation site.
```

## How to contribute

- Make sure the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (v14) is installed on Windows.

### Preparations

- Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) first.

- Clone this project and switch to `dev` branch.

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/T0nyX1ang/noqx.git
    git checkout dev
```

- Install all dependencies with `uv`:

```bash
    uv sync --all-extras
```

- Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and add commit hooks:

```bash
    uv pre-commit install
```

### Write a new solver

- Create a python file in the `solver` folder and write solver codes in that file. The functions in the `noqx` package are free to use.

- Create a class inheriting the base class `noqx.manager.Solver`. It is recommended to read the [Solver Manager](./noqx/manager.md) section for further reference.

- (Optional) Set the metadata of the solver. It is recommended to read the [Solver Manager](./noqx/manager.md) section for further reference.

- Implement a `solve` function and write the ASP program needed. The data structures are detailed in the `Puzzle Encodings` section, especially in the `noqx.puzzle.Puzzle` class. The useful rules are detailed in the `Useful Rules` section.

- (Optional) Implement a `refine` function if extra refinement is needed after program solving. It is recommended to read the document of the `noqx.manager.store_solution` API for further reference.

- Test the solver manually by running `main.py` with the specified solver and puzzle.

### Test solvers

- Run the tests (with default `unittest` features) with `uv`:

```bash
    uv run coverage run -m unittest
```

- Check the HTML version of coverage report with `uv`:

```bash
    uv run coverage html
```

### Build documents

- Build the documents with `uv`, `mkdocs-material` and `mkdocstrings-python`:

```bash
    uv run mkdocs build
```
