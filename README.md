# Noqx

Extended logic puzzle solver of Noq.

## Current development status

- Remove redundant codes and formatting codes.

- New solver API with new visualizations (See issue [#2](https://github.com/T0nyX1ang/noqx/issues/2))

## How to run locally

### Use PDM with a virtual environment (Recommended)

- Install [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/latest/) first.

- Install dependencies with PDM:

```bash
    pdm install
```

- Run Django with PDM:

```bash
    pdm run manage.py runserver
```

### Use PIP

- Install requirements (automatically generated by PDM):

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run Django locally (based on your system):

```bash
    py -3 manage.py runserver
    python3 manage.py runserver
```

## Noq (Original Project)

Noq is currently accessible on the web at [noq.solutions](https://www.noq.solutions/), formerly at [mstang.xyz/noq](https://www.mstang.xyz/noq). It is powered by Django and runs on a PythonAnywhere web server.

The solver guide can be found [here](./solvers/utils/README.md). Once all the solvers are rewritten in Clingo, a new solver guide is expected to be here.
